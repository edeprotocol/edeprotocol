# EDE — 2040 Use Cases

This document is not core spec.  
It sketches how EDE becomes non-optional once H+ and SO are part of critical systems.

---

## 1. H+ Command & Control (Critical Ops)

**Context (2032–2040):**

High-bandwidth H+ operators plugged into fleets of SO for military, orbital infra, emergency response, financial defense.

**Without EDE:**

- Each vendor invents its own identity / intent / settlement layer.
- No shared way to prove who was in the loop, what they did, and at what cognitive cost.

**With EDE:**

- **NIR**: registers H / H+ / SO operators with substrate class and PQ keys.
- **NIL**: standard packets for "approve / abort / escalate / delegate" to agent swarms.
- **CSL + CT**: canonical log of all augmented sessions and CT flows per operator.

**Outcome:**

States and infra providers can audit "who really decided what" and fund H+ cohorts as cognitive infra, not just headcount.

## 2. Capital Allocation with H+ / SO Swarms

**Context:**

Sovereign funds, infra funds, and AGI-native hedge funds use H+ investment committees + SO research swarms.

**Without EDE:**

- "AI-assisted" investment is a black box.
- No way to price or collateralize the cognitive work of H+ / SO.

**With EDE:**

- **NIR**: types decision nodes (H+, SO) and their substrate capabilities.
- **NIL**: binds human-level directives ("re-underwrite this infra cluster") to concrete agent workflows.
- **CT + CSL**: measures cognitive expenditure per decision (per deal, per H+ operator, per SO cluster).

**Outcome:**

Cognitive portfolios become an asset class: investors can back "H+ / SO clusters" with measurable CT history, not just management teams.

## 3. Neural Web / Synthetic Cities

**Context:**

Hybrid H+ / SO "cities" where most planning and coordination is done by fused human–machine clusters.

**Without EDE:**

- Identities, permissions and economic flows are app-local and fragile.
- No shared way to move H+ / SO between stacks or jurisdictions.

**With EDE:**

- **NIR**: portable identity for H / H+ / SO across domains.
- **NIL**: common intent format so that different agent OS / AGI stacks can still be driven by the same H+ mind.
- **CSL + CT (+ FusionProofs)**: long-term trace of fusion episodes and cognitive contributions, usable as proof for credit, governance or rewards.

**Outcome:**

"Neural cities" can interoperate and settle cognition as infra, not as a by-product hidden inside apps.

## 4. Post-Human Liability & Insurance

**Context:**

When an H+ operator fused with SO swarms makes a decision that causes damages, who is liable?

**Without EDE:**

- No audit trail of who was in the loop.
- No way to attribute cognitive contribution.
- Insurance is impossible to price.

**With EDE:**

- **CSL**: immutable record of every decision point.
- **FusionProofs**: cryptographic proof of which substrates were fused at decision time.
- **CT flows**: economic attribution of cognitive work.

**Outcome:**

Insurers can underwrite H+ / SO operations. Liability can be attributed. Cognitive work becomes insurable.

## 5. AGI Alignment Verification

**Context:**

How do you prove that a human was genuinely in the loop when an AGI made a consequential decision?

**Without EDE:**

- "Human in the loop" is a checkbox, not a proof.
- No way to verify after the fact.

**With EDE:**

- **NAL (Neuro-Liveness)**: proves biological human was actually present.
- **NIL packets**: show what intent was actually transmitted.
- **CSL**: immutable timeline of human ↔ agent interaction.

**Outcome:**

Regulators can verify "human in the loop" claims. AGI labs can prove alignment compliance.

## Summary

| Use Case | Critical EDE Component | Value Unlocked |
|----------|------------------------|----------------|
| H+ Command & Control | NIR + NIL + CSL | Auditable cognitive ops |
| Capital Allocation | CT + CSL | Cognitive portfolios as asset class |
| Neural Cities | NIR + NIL (portable) | Interoperable H+ / SO identity |
| Liability & Insurance | CSL + FusionProofs | Insurable cognitive work |
| AGI Alignment | NAL + NIL + CSL | Verifiable "human in the loop" |

## Why This Matters

These are not features.  
These are **systems that will exist** once H+ and SO are real.

The question is:
- Will they be built on closed, proprietary layers?
- Or on an open, verifiable protocol?

EDE is designed to be that protocol.
