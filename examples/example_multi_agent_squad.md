# Example – H+ and Agent Squad Orchestration (Conceptual)



This example shows how an H+ operator could interact with an agent squad using EDE:



1. NIR record for `did:neuro:mainnet:hplus-operator-001`

2. NIL_Stream of decoded trading thoughts

3. NIL_Intents for high-impact execution

4. CSL session aggregating all activity



This file is intentionally high-level; implementations can add concrete JSON examples for NIL_Orchestration once the schema is finalized.
